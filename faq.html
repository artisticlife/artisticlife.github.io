          <h3 id="procedure">Adoption Procedure</h3>
          <p>We are committed to placing pets into homes where they will be enjoyed and loved for their lifetime. We want our fosters and the people who adopt them to be happy and comfortable with each other. Our adoption process is in place to ensure that we make good matches and, though it can be difficult for us to choose one home over another or decline an adoption application, we do so with the best interest of our foster pets in mind. You will always be told if we have a concern with your application or any other part of the process. We believe in honesty and education, so you will know if there is a problem. We hope you will understand the choices we make.</p>
          <p>Every applicant will start by filling out our adoption application. This form is designed to help us have a better understanding of your home and what you are looking for in a pet. In the application there is a form that will give permission for us to contact your Veterinarian. If you do not have a current Veterinarian, you may enter the name of a previous Vet you have used. We do call Vets on all applications. We feel that the best way to predict the care you will give your new pet, is to establish that you have provided care in the past. If you are new to pet ownership, this may not be the place for you to start. In all honesty, it would be difficult for us to adopt to a home with no pet experience. That is not to say you could not be a great home, but with so many homeless pets, you have other options for adoption and we are sure you will find a pet elsewhere. If you would still like to apply and can provide some references, please do so and we will do our best to accommodate you or refer you to another rescue.</p>
          <p>Everyone will be contacted by phone or email and any questions about your application or your Vet check will be discussed. If we feel confident a good match has been found, we will schedule a home visit. At this time, we will bring the foster pet to your home for you to meet them. We do not do meetings with the pet prior to the application and vet check. It can be very stressful for pets to be taken to multiple meetings. And there would be many if we took them to see everyone that shows an interest. We do not put them through that unless we know you will qualify. We do not have a shelter for you to visit, so this is the way we have chosen to do meetings. You are under no obligation to adopt when you meet the pet if you do not feel it is a good match. We will check your home for any hazards or issues that may need to be resolved, but mainly, we will look at how comfortable the foster pet is there. We feel that the fosters pick their homes. When a foster is fairly calm in your home and happy to meet you, we feel like that is the home for them. If you feel the same way, then a great match has been made. In some instances you may be able to keep your new pet starting immediately. If you need time to consider, you will be given time. We will not move on to another home until we have made a decision on the first home.</p>
          <p>This may seem a little much for some of you. We take responsibility for these pets for a lifetime. If, for any reason, an unforeseeable event should make it necessary to return a pet, we take them back into our rescue. We are a small rescue. Imagine if we didn’t take great care in selecting homes. We must do our best to ensure that our pets stay in their homes and are cared for to our high standards. We would not like a dog returned years later and have to pay for heartworm treatment because a home did not keep the dog on heartworm prevention. That would take a lot of resources that could be used for saving other dogs from euthanasia. Even worse, we would hate to find out one of our fosters had passed away due to negligence. We love these pets in our own home. We provide the very best Veterinary care and preventative medicine. We expect an adoptive home to do the same.</p>
          <p>We also charge an adoption donation. We cannot save other pets if we cannot pay our medical bills or buy food. We rely on donations to function. We put more money into your future pet than you will pay in an adoption fee 99% of the time. Our adoption fee will depend on how much we have put into the pet medically. We do not even add up the other costs of feeding and housing the pet. Most times, you will be provided with a list of medical treatments and expenses so that you are aware of what they entail. Most adoption fees will be between $75 and $150. That number could be less or more, but it is important to us that the fee not be too extremely high.</p>
          <p>If you have gotten this far, it is fair to assume that you understand our intention with finding great homes for our great pets. If this is not for you, please check with other rescues, as we all have different rules to go by. By all means, if you want a pet right away and don’t want to go through an adoption process, please go to a local shelter and adopt a pet that might not make it out if not for you.</p>

          </div>
          <p>I am asked the same question when people hear that I foster animals. First they say, “That’s so great that you can do this” and then they say, “but I could never do it. I would get too attached. How do you let them go?” The answer is simple and it is complicated. The truth is, I don’t have a secret for not getting attached. I don’t know of a way to make it easy. I do become attached. It takes me very little time to become attached. The first time I look into their eyes and I know that I am responsible for the life that they will have, I am attached. They are a part of me. It does hurt to let them go, but that pain is tempered by the fact that, I cannot keep them all and to help more, I HAVE to let them go.</p>
          <p>It is as simple as that day you say to yourself, “I can foster and let them go because it is for the best and it will help so many.” Instead of telling yourself, “I can’t do that because it will hurt me too much.”</p>
          <p>It is as complicated as that also. The changing what you tell yourself.</p>
          <p>For years I wanted to foster pets. I made excuses for not doing it “right now”. I don’t have time. I don’t know how to start. I have pets of my own. But, fostering choose me and I ran out of excuses. It’s not meant to be easy. It’s meant to be helpful and good. It’s meant to save lives and rehabilitate mistreated pets. It is hard, but it is necessary.</p>
          <p>Should I have done it sooner? Maybe not. Maybe I gave the excuses until I was done and accepted fostering when Annie dug into my yard because I was ready. (See Annie’s Story) I didn’t have to foster her. Or, I could have stopped when I found her a home. But, I did foster Annie and I did go on to foster more dogs after Annie. Why? Because as much as it hurts to let them go, it felt amazing to know that I contributed to making her life better. And I can do it again and again.</p>
          <p>I’ve seen some posts where people feel bullied about NOT fostering. I don’t think it is something you should be pushed into. You need to be ready to say to yourself, “this is not my dog, but I will love this dog like it is mine and then I will find him a home of his own.” You need to be able to be strong and resolved to do this thing called fostering. It isn’t an easy thing. Sometimes there are hard decisions. But, if you are to the point where you think you might be giving yourself excuses when fostering is something that you truly want to do, try it once. With one pet. And if the worste thing that happens, is that you keep that one pet, oh well. That pet has a home. But, if you find that in the giving up, you gain something. Keep doing it.</p>
          <p>I read a post once that compared fostering pets to raising children. You know one day that they will grow up and leave home. Have their own lives. And maybe when they do it hurts. But, knowing this, you have children anyway. You raise them and they move off and find their own lives. It is a bit of a different thing. Hopefully your children come home and visit from time to time 🙂 But, you know you are doing something worthwhile and that gives you a great sense of fulfillment.</p>
          <p>That is fostering to me. I can’t keep them all. I won’t be able to save them all. But, I can make the difference in the lives of many. A big difference. And that is how I let them go.</p>

          <h3 id="puppies" class="u-pull-left">Raising Puppies for Adoption</h3><a href="#" class="scrollToTop" class="u-pull-right">Scroll To Top</a>
          <div class="u-cf"></div>
          <p>I wanted to share with everyone my methods and thoughts about readying puppies for adoption. I don’t take in puppies often as they are usually easier to find homes for and I focus on adult dogs. I have fostered a puppy alone and fostered puppies with their mothers and litter mates. A puppy on his or her own takes a lot more involvement for sure. Puppies and dogs in general, do not want to be alone. A solo puppy foster needs you all of the time. A litter of pups with mom and siblings, while a lot to clean up after and care for, have their family to keep them company. I have been lucky in the past with solo puppies because my old dog, Mac, is a great puppy caretaker. He is getting a bit too old to enjoy puppy duty as much as he used to, but my young dog, Indy, is shaping up to be a great “uncle” to the puppies I am fostering now. This means sometimes I can sit down and work on my iPad outside while watching the pups in the exercise pen as mom or “uncle” Indy take on playtime duty.</p>
          <p>So, I have my way that I do things with puppies I foster. First of all, I do not make puppies available for adoption until after they have been spayed or neutered. This just makes me feel better. I know FOR SURE that they are fixed before they leave me and will never contribute to more unwanted puppies. I also, do not like to spay/neuter super early. So, my puppies are usually 3 to 3 and 1/2 months old at surgery time, unless the vet thinks we should wait longer. This has to due with my background as a veterinary technician. Early spay/neuter is crucial to combating the huge pet overpopulation problem. I do not disagree with rescues/shelters that do this. From a veterinary stand point, there may be a link to some physical development issues over the life of the pet due to early spay/neuter. Everyone has their opinion on this, I just err on the side of caution when it comes to my fosters.</p>
          <p>Not adopting out at 8 weeks old also has to do with the way I feel about puppy social development. When I have a mother and a litter of pups, I feel that they need to stay together and learn a few things. They need to learn bite inhibition or the ability to regulate their bite strength. They learn this partially by making their siblings angry when they bite them too hard. They also need to learn this from people. Puppies tend to go after hands when they are excited about a toy a person may be holding, so it is important to redirect puppy teeth to toys and Nylabones (my personal favorite brand of chew bone). Also, I feel puppies need time to slowly transition from being with their family into being alone. I crate train as a rule in my rescue. Mothers are crated with their pups to start. At about 6-7 weeks old, depending on how mom is dealing with weening, I start to crate the pups in a seperate crate at night. This helps mom have the night to herself, at this time she is usually getting tired of puppies tackling her, and helps her to slow milk production. The puppies have each other and I let them nurse just before bed at first, so they do remarkably well with this. Then when puppies are 8-10 weeks old, I start to put them in their own crates at night. Believe me, my adoptive households are grateful for this early crate training. Puppies learn to sleep at night on their own without being suddenly taken from a family bed and put into a home where everything is new.</p>
          <p>Housetraining is also usually easier for adoptive homes when the puppies are older than 12 weeks. Before this, the puppy can physicaly on “hold it” for so long. At about 4-5 weeks old, I begin to take puppies outside to a designated safe spot with mom to get the feel of going potty outside. I begin to say the words “good potty” to them to associate the word “potty” with going to the bathroom outside. Puppies are not able to hold it at 4-5 weeks old, but if you pick them up and take them outside after they have eaten and as soon as they wake up from a nap, you will get some pottying outside and the reinforcement of that behavior has begun.</p>
          <p>My goal is to have puppies that are all ready starting to understand proper behavior, have a leg up (pun intended) on potty training and are comfortable being by themselves for periods of time at night. I believe laying the groundwork will hopefully lead to better behaved dogs and less stress in a new home. A 3 to 4 month old puppy is still plenty of puppy and it is easier to get an idea of breed and size when they are a bit older than 8 weeks.</p>
          <p>I know, puppies are fun, lots of people want very young puppies. Just keep in mind, puppyhood lasts for a very short period of time. An adoptive home needs to love their new dog as an adult for much longer. Hopefully at least 12-16 years, depending on breed. So, are you willing to wait for one of my foster pups a month or so longer? I hope so. If not, make sure that when you adopt a young puppy, that you take the time to train them. Dogs are not born knowing how we want them to act. We have to teach them. :)</p>

          <h3 id="howWeFoster" class="u-pull-left">How We Foster</h3><a href="#" class="scrollToTop" class="u-pull-right">Scroll To Top</a>
          <div class="u-cf"></div>
          <p>Some of you may not know how we keep our fosters. We do not have a shelter. In fact, at this early stage, what we have is my house. The fosters we have right now are Chewy the 14 year old Chow, Lucy the 2 year old Pit Bull Terrier, and Sissy the Toy Fox Terrier (with her two puppies, Lilly and Moby born 5-5-2012). We do not house these dogs in cages. We do crate train as a rule. However, we decided against crate training Chewy at her advanced age. She had never been contained, not even boarded, and we felt it would be too stressful for her. One good thing about senior dogs is, they know most of the rules all ready and usually don’t have to have as much training. We crate train so that the dogs have a place that is their own for eating and sleeping at night and if we have to be away from the house.</p>
          <p>We are very careful when a new dog comes here. We are slow and deliberate with our introductions. We have 4 dogs of our own. Two elderly large dogs and two young small dogs. You may see them from time to time in pictures of our fosters. Typically, all of our dogs and fosters at the time, will be put inside or crated or otherwise contained when we bring home a new dog. The dog is first introduced to the yard and the smells of the other dogs. When they are comfortable, they are introduced slowly to other dogs in the household. Usually, my old dogs first. They are expert greeters :). We have not set a time period for introduction and assimilation into our pack. We procede at the pace of each dog, and we never leave new dogs alone with other dogs until we are confident THEY are confident in the situation. Our goal is always to have foster dogs enjoy our property and our house as if they were our own dogs. Because, the truth is, they are our own dogs. Until they are adopted into another family, these dogs are loved and cared for and taught manners and played with as if this is their home.</p>
          <p>We feel fostering dogs in homes is the best way to know them before adoption. Dogs that come from shelters, or even direct from other homes, have a transition period. For some dogs that may be a few days For most it is closer to two weeks. This means that we may not see all of their behaviors for awhile. Once they are comfortable, they start acting like themselves. Once we see who these dogs are and what they can tolerate and what they cannot, then we are better able to match them to the right home. We also find behaviors that we need to work on. This is not a quick in, quick out rescue. We take as much time as we need in order to work with our dogs and possible adopters. This way we feel more confident that our adoptions will last a lifetime.</p>
